# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly 
# Here we implemented a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
